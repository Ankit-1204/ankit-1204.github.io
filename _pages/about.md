🕵️‍♀️ I am Ankit Upadhyay, third year undergraduate at MNNIT,Allahabad

🛠️ I have worked on multiple projects in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, and more.

🌍 As a new open-source contributor, I’m getting involved in the community to help improve tools and libraries.

# My Experiences
## Open Source Contribution 🤝
I’ve recently started contributing to [sktime](https://github.com/sktime), a framework for time-series analysis. It’s been a rewarding experience adding features and learning from the open-source community while enhancing my skills in time-series forecasting and model development.

## Implementation 💡
I’m very interested in having a in depth understanding of different ML algorithms. To explore this, I’ve implemented some key research papers.

- I Experimented with MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) to see how models can quickly adapt to new tasks.
- I’ve worked on implementing KMeans Clustering for image compression
 
  (😅 My first shot at image compression with my own implementation!)

- I have worked on implementing DQN Algo from Scratch and a wrapper for Chess environment.

## FAIR AI
🎯 I competed in the Enigma ML competition, focusing on building a model that balances accuracy and fairness, ensuring precision without bias.

Through this, I also learned how to use Optuna for hyperparameter tuning and applied in-depth data analysis to enhance model performance.

🕵️‍♀️ I am Ankit Upadhyay, Third Year Undergraduate at National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India.

🛠️ I am passionate about Machine Learning and have gained experience in Time Series Analysis, Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning

🌍 As an open-source contributor, I’m getting involved in the community to help improve tools and libraries.

# My Experiences
## Open Source Contribution 🤝
I'm currently working under the mentorship program of [sktime](https://github.com/sktime), a framework for time-series analysis. It’s been a rewarding experience adding features and learning from the open-source community while enhancing my skills in time-series forecasting and model development.


## Implementation 💡
I’m very interested in having a in depth understanding of different ML algorithms. To explore this, I’ve implemented some key research papers.

- I have implemented Proximity Policy Optimization(PPO) Algorithm for Cartpole Problem. Check it out here [ppo-cart](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ankitupadhyay12/ppo-cart)
- I’ve worked on implementing KMeans Clustering for image compression

- I have Implemented DQN Algo from Scratch and a wrapper for Chess environment.

## FAIR AI
🎯 I competed in the Enigma ML competition, focusing on building a model that balances accuracy and fairness, ensuring precision without bias.

Through this, I also learned how to use Optuna for hyperparameter tuning and applied in-depth data analysis to enhance model performance.
